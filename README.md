# Runing Project
to run the project first you need to install all packages lets start with client side:
```
cd client
```
now lets install packages:
```
npm install
```
or
```
yarn install
```
and run the app:
```
npm run dev
```

and in the server side (open new terminal window):
```
cd server
```
and install..
```
npm install
